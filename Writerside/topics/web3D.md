# web3D

## Overview

## Step I

Search the current web3D technology and engine, I know that the available three.js engine and babylon.js engine.

[three.js](https://threejs.org/)

I prefer that you use three.js directly and learn the JavaScript language.
You can learn to view the samples of three.js, and then find the functions we need from it, and modify it to achieve an
effect that can be integrated into our project.

[three.js samples](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_keyframes)

> To sum up, understand the existing web3D technology, learn to understand three.js and related samples source code.
